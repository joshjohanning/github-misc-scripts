# github-misc-scripts

Miscellaneous GitHub scripts, `gh` commands, API calls, GraphQL queries, etc. for power user automation.

See the folder categories:
- [api](/api)
- [gh cli](gh-cli) 🚀 ✨ ⬅️ *most updated!*
- [git](git)
- [graphql](graphql)
- [scripts](scripts)

> [!TIP]
> The **[gh cli](gh-cli)** folder is the most maintained; I've started adding both API and GraphQL queries in there using `gh api` commands.
