# Need to run this to get the repo delete scope: gh auth refresh -h github.com -s delete_repo

# Usage: 
# Step 1: Run ./generate-repositories-list.sh <org> > repos.csv 
#   - Or create a list of repos in a csv file, 1 per line, with a trailing empty line at the end of the file
#   - DO NOT REMOVE TRAILING NEW LINE IN THE INPUT CSV FILE
# Step 2: ./delete-repositories-from-list.sh repos.csv
