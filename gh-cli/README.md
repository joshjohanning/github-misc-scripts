### copy-organization-members.sh

Copy organization members from one organization to the other, the member will **retain** the source role (owner or member), member cannot be demoted, if they already exist at the target with an owner role they cannot be demoted to member.

On Enterprise Managed Users organizations the users are only added if they are part of the Enterprise already (they need to be provisioned by the IDP)

On GitHub Enterprise Cloud the added users will get an invitation to join the organization.

> [!WARNING]
> For GitHub Enterprise Cloud the number of users you can copy in a day is limited per target org. See [API note on rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/orgs/members?apiVersion=2022-11-28#set-organization-membership-for-a-user) for the limit values.

This script requires 2 environment variables (with another optional one):

- SOURCE_TOKEN - A GitHub Token to access data from the source organization. Requires `org:read` and `repo` scopes.
- TARGET_TOKEN - A GitHub Token to set data on the target organization. Requires `org:admin` and `repo` scopes.
- MAP_USER_SCRIPT - path to a script to map user login. This is optional, if you set this environment value it will call the script to map user logins before adding them on the target repo. The script will receive the user login as the first argument and it should return the new login. For example, if you want to add a suffix to the user login:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

echo "$1"_SHORTCODE
```

You can have more complex mappings this just a basic example, where a copy is being done between a GHEC and a GHEC EMU instance where the logins are going to be exactly the same, but the EMU instance has a suffix on the logins.

### copy-organization-team-members.sh

Copy organization team members from one organization to the other, the member will **retain** the source role (maintainer, member).

It copies the members of team members of teams in the source organization but only for teams that also exist in the target organization.

This script requires 2 environment variables (with another optional one):

- SOURCE_TOKEN - A GitHub Token to access data from the source organization. Requires `org:read` scopes.
- TARGET_TOKEN - A GitHub Token to set data on the target organization. Requires `org:admin` and `repo` scopes.
- MAP_USER_SCRIPT - path to a script to map user login. This is optional, if you set this environment value it will call the script to map user logins before adding them on the target repo. The script will receive the user login as the first argument and it should return the new login. For example, if you want to add a suffix to the user login:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

echo "$1"_SHORTCODE
```

You can have more complex mappings this just a basic example, where a copy is being done between a GHEC and a GHEC EMU instance where the logins are going to be exactly the same, but the EMU instance has a suffix on the logins.

> [!WARNING]
> If users are not members of the target organizations they will not be added to the target team but may receive an invite to join the org.

### copy-organization-variables.sh

Copy organization variables from one organization to another.

If the variable already exists on the target organization it will be updated.

> [!WARNING]
> If the variable is available to selected repositories and a repository with the same doesn't exist on the target organization that association is ignored.

### copy-permissions-between-org-repos.sh

Copy user and team repository member permissions to another repository (it can be in the same or on different organizations).

External collaborators are not copied intentionally.

If the team (or children of that team) on the target organization doesn't exist, one will be created (same name, description, privacy, and notification settings ONLY),if the team has children teams those will also be created (full tree, not only direct children).

> [!NOTE]
> The created team will not be a full copy, **Only** name, description and visibilility are honored. If the team is is associated with an IDP group it will not be honored. If you want to change this behavior, you can modify the `internal/__copy_team_and_children_if_not_exists_at_target.sh` script.

This script requires 2 environment variables (with another optional one):

- SOURCE_TOKEN - A GitHub Token to access data from the source organization. Requires `org:read` and `repo` scopes.
- TARGET_TOKEN - A GitHub Token to set data on the target organization. Requires `org:admin` and `repo` scopes.
- MAP_USER_SCRIPT - path to a script to map user login. This is optional, if you set this environment value it will call the script to map user logins before adding them on the target repo. The script will receive the user login as the first argument and it should return the new login. For example, if you want to add a suffix to the user login:

```shell

```

You can have more complex mappings this just a basic example, where a copy is being done between a GHEC and a GHEC EMU instance where the logins are going to be exactly the same, but the EMU instance has a suffix on the logins.

### copy-repository-environments.sh

It copies all [environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) and copies the following settings:

- [Required Reviewers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#required-reviewers)
- [Wait Timer](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#wait-timer)
- [Deployment Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#deployment-branches)

> [!NOTE]
> The following settings are **not** copied:

> [!NOTE]
> Only direct members are copied, child team members are not copied.

If the target team already has user they will be preserved, this **doesn't** synch members between teams, it merely copies them. If you want a synch then you need to delete the existem team members in the target team before running this script.

This script requires 2 environment variables (with another optional one):

- SOURCE_TOKEN - A GitHub Token to access data from the source organization. Requires `org:read` scopes.
- TARGET_TOKEN - A GitHub Token to set data on the target organization. Requires `org:admin` and `repo` scopes.

### parent-organization-teams.sh

The script has three parameters:

- `target-org` - The target organization name to which teams will be updated OR created
- `create parent(s) if not exist` - OPTIONAL (default `false`) if set to true, the teams which have parents that do not exist in the target org, they will be created. (also creates parents of parents) otherwise it will print a message parent doesn't exist and it will skipped.

### set-ip-allow-list-rules.sh

Sets the IP allow list rules for an enterprise or organization from a set of rules defined in a file. The script is idempotent; running it multiple times will only make the changes needed to match the rules in the file.

In order to ensure availability of the service, the script first adds all necessary rules and only after that will delete rules no longer applicable. This ensures no disruption of service if the change has an (partial) overlapping set of rules.

Optionally, you can opt-in in to save a backup of rules on GitHub before the changes are applied.

> [!WARNING]
> The script doesn't take into account if existing rules are active. If changes are made to an inactive rule it will be become active. If no changes are made, then active status will be ignored.

This script requires `org:admin` scope.

The file with the rules should be in the following format:

```json
{
    "list": [
        {
            "name": "proxy-us",
            "ip": "192.168.1.1"
        },
        {
            "name": "proxy-us",
            "ip": "192.168.1.2"
        },
        {
            "name": "proxy-eu",
            "ip": "192.168.88.0/23"
        }
    ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The script logic is independent of the rules format since the file is normalized before comparisons are performed. If you want to use a different format, a surgical change to the rules normalization can be made (see script source code,search for `CUSTOMIZE` keyword)

Run the script in `dry-run` to get a preview of the changes without actually applying them.

### set-ip-allow-list-setting.sh

Sets the IP allow list to enabled/disable for an enterprise or organization. You can't enable the IP allow list unless the IP running the script is in the list.
